@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously 
converted data from ADC1 to memory.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously Voltage reference and Temperature 
sensor.
Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC1 DR register to the RegularConvData_Tab[] table.

@note The "system_stm32f0xx.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F0xx devices, and is customized for use with STM32F0-Discovery Kit. 
      The STM32F0xx is configured to run at 48 MHz, following the three  
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system 
             clock source.  
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE          
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some 
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS   
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from 
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as 
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE 
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f0xx.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSI).

         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F0-Discovery (MB1034) 
    RevB and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    
  - STM32F0-Discovery Set-up
    - None.
